# UdacityDeepLearningNanodegree_Navigation
A repository containing my files for submission to the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, project 1: Navigation.


# Project 1: Navigation

## Aim of the project 

The aim of this project is given by Udacity as follows: 

> For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

> A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

> The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

> 0 - move forward.
> 1 - move backward.
> 2 - turn left.
> 3 - turn right.
> The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Installing dependencies and/or downloading needed files 

In order to install the dependencies the reader would need in order to run this project for themselves, please follow the information provided by Udacity. NOTE that the "DRLND Github repository" is Udacity's home repository for this project, found [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning): 

> 1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
   >  - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
   >  - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
   >  - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
   >  - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
>    *For Windows users* Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

>    *For AWS* If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

> 2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

> Follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` to get started with training your own agent!  

## Instructions 

In order to run the code in this repository, please load `Navigation.ipynb` into your Jupyter notebook-capable programme of choice. Please ensure that you have both `agent.py` and `model.py` also loaded into the local area as `Navigation.ipynb` calls from them. Please also ensure you have installed the dependencies UDacity has highlighted in their section above.
